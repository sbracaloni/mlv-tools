# Tutorial Setup

This is the setup section for realistic tutorial.

## 1. Create Project Structure

All resource files needed in this tutorial are provided in `ml-poc-version/resources`.
The structure of the project will be created along the tutorial.

If it is not already done, clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/peopledoc/mlv-tools-tutorial

Create your own branch

    git checkout -b experiment
    

Create the project structure.

    make init-struct

    > The following structure must be created

    ├── poc
    │ ├── commands
    │ │  └─── dvc           # contains dvc command wrapped in a bash script
    │ ├── data              # contains pipeline data
    │ └── pipeline
    │   ├── notebooks       # contains Jupyter notebooks (one by pipeline step)
    │   └─── steps          # contains generated configurable Python 3 scripts


> It is not mandatory to follow this structure, it is just an example for this tutorial.

The tutorial resources are stored in `./resources`

    ├── resources                         # contains Jupyter notebooks needed in this tutorial
    │   ├── 01_Extract_dataset.ipynb
    │   ├── 02_Tokenize_text.ipynb
    │   ├── 03_bis_Classify_text.ipynb
    │   ├── 03_Classify_text.ipynb
    │   ├── 04_Evaluate_model.ipynb
    │   └── [...]

## 2. Prepare Environment

Create a virtual environment using **conda** or **virtualenv**, then activate it.
Install the project dependencies.

    make develop

## 3. Initialize the DVC Project
**DVC** works on top of **git** repositories. Run **DVC** initialization in a **git**
 repository directory to create **DVC meta files**.

    dvc init

The directory `.dvc` should be created in the project root directory.

Add it under git versioning:

    git commit -m 'Tutorial setup: dvc init' ./.dvc/

## 4. Create MLV-tools Project Configuration

Using **MLV-tools**, it can be repetitive to repeat output paths parameters for each `ipynb_to_python` 
and `gen_dvc` command. 

It is possible to provide a configuration to declare project structure and
 let **MLV-tools** generates output path.
(For more information see [documentation](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow))

    make mlvtools-conf

The configuration file `./.mlvtools` should be created.

Add it under git versioning:

    git add .mlvtools && git commit -m 'Tutorial setup: mlvtools setup'

## 5. Add Git Hooks and Filters

### 5.1 Automatise Jupyter Notebook Cleanup

Usually it is not useful to version **Jupyter notebook** embedded outputs. Sometimes it is even forbidden,
if you work on production data for example. To avoid mistakes, use git pre-commit or git filter to cleanup
**Jupyter notebook** outputs. Several tools can do that, 
see for example [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout).

    pip install --upgrade nbstripout
    nbstripout --install

With **nbstripout** git filter, **Jupyter notebook** outputs are cleaned on each branch on check-in. That means 
when you will commit a change you will keep outputs into the notebook to continue working.
 But those outputs will not be sent to the remote server when you push. 
 Notebook outputs are also excluded from the git diff.

## 6. Get Tutorial Data

This tutorial is based on data from [20_newsgroup](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/).
Run the following command to download them.

    make download-data

Data are stored in `./poc/data/20news-bydate_py3.pkz`.
